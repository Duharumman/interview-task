- Describe in your own words what is z-score and Min-Max scaling and why would we need to use such normalization methods? describe by example, if possible.
```
first of all I would to explain what is Normalization 
In general, Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database. 
we can say it is a sammary or describe the data based on some formella in other words look closely to the data or thinking of clean data, 
so we used the most commonly Normalization Technique 
1) z-score 
        The most common type of normalization is z-scores. 
        A z-score normalizes each data point to the standard deviation. 
        The formula is the following:
            Z = (x-µ) / σ
            where :
                Z	=	standard score
                x	=	observed value
                µ	=	mean of the sample
                σ	=	standard deviation of the sample
                

2) min-max score
    Min-max normalization is one of the most common ways to normalize data.
      The formula is the following:
      {value - min}/{max - min} 
      



 Z score is also called standard score. it measures the distance between a data point and the mean using standard deviations.

- We used Junit5 in our test cases, describe in your own words why would we use such library? 
what is unit testing and why would we use it?

    
```
- the unit testing is a type of test code  
- What Unit Testing Is :
  - test is code 
  - It executes target code
  - Testing a small piece of code: class, method/function
  - Check to see if the results are correct

- juit >>> Java Unit Tests 
  - JUnit is a Java unit testing framework that’s one of the best test methods for regression testing. An open-source framework,
  there are two juit junit5 and junit4 
  
```
- What is the IDE did you use?
 

```
- IntelliJ
```

- Name the Java APIs you used?
```
nio Non-blocking I/O (Java)

```

- Mention down any difficulties or concerns you faced while working on the task. Your feedback is appreciated :D.
```
The task  was really fun and I didn't find any difficulties xD 
```

- If you implement any of the bonus points, please mentioned it in this file
```
write your answer here
```

- Did this task enrich technical skills or knowledge? If yes, tell us how: 
```
yes .
there are two  things  I used for the first time as :
  BigDecimal  it was a big knowledge for me to deal with it
  read and write from cvs format  
```
